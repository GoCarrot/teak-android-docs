2.2.0
-----
:Breaking Changes:
    * None
:New Features:
    * ``FOREGROUND_NOTIFICATION_INTENT`` is broadcast when a Push Notification is recieved while the app is in the foreground.
    * ``ms_since_first_event`` is now sent with batched requests.
    * Added ``deviceBoard`` and ``deviceProduct`` to device information.
    * ``Teak.setLogListener`` for getting callbacks when the Teak SDK would log an event.
:Bug Fixes:
    * Suppress some log spam when looking to see if ``NotificationManagerCompat.areNotificationsEnabled`` is supported.
    * Stopped some of the fine-grain checking for what ``IInAppBillingService`` supports, to prevent possible ANRs.
    * All threads and executors are now named, so that any ANR/crash report which includes thread names will clearly show what Teak is doing in that ANR/crash.
